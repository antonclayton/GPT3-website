# Mock GPT-3 Website (React + Vite)

By Anton Clayton

## Skills used:
- JavaScript
- JSX
- CSS
- React

## Description:
This project is a follow along by Javascript Mastery on Youtube with a few of my own touches. I recognized that my styling and other fundamental skills were lacking before this project and so I searched to find a project that would focus basic React and CSS skills. The website is a "mock" company website for ChatGPT and has no actual functionality beyond a working navigation bar. However, the website looks aesthetic and it will be a blueprint for my future projects.

## What I learned:
- BEM naming convention for class names
- Efficient, clean React file structure
- General CSS styling tricks and skills
- Using js files to import many components/images in one line of code
- How to build the foundation/plan for a react app
